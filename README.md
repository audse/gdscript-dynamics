# Godot Second-Order Dynamics

### An implementation of a second-order dynamic system in GDScript.

This is a second-order dynamic system for Godot 4. This helps make really natural procedural animation.

Credit goes to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPoeNZZ6H4s) for explaining the concepts. My code is translated and slightly expanded from the code shared in that video.
